This script is designed to take zone files exported from specific other DNS
providers and modify them to a standard BIND style format that can be
imported to DynECT. Symptoms of a malformed zonefile are lack of trailing
periods on CNAME/SRV/MX records as well as other minor issues with SRV
records.

Usage: %python zonfile_repair.py FILES [-d FOLDER|--dir FOLDER |-b|-backup]

Details:
FILES		Accepts a single file of file pattern. No validation is done for valid zone file
-h, --help      Show help message and exit
-b, --backup    Create a backup of the zonefile before processing. Defaults directory is /BACKUP
-d, --dir       Defines the folder where backups should be placed instead of using /BACKUP
=========================================================================================
Usage Examples:
  
-Attempts to correct the file 'test.zone' without creating backup
% python zonefile_repair.py test.zone

Attempts to correct the file 'test.zone' with creating a backup of the 
original file in the folder /BACKUP
% python zonefile_repair.py test.zone -b

Attempts to correct all files matching pattern '*.ZONE' while creating a 
backup of original files in folder /TEST
% python zonefile_repair.py *.ZONE -d TEST
